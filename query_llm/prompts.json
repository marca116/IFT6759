Your output should be formatted as a JSON object, with the reasoning behind your answer and your actual answer(s) in two separate fields. There can be more than one answer to a specific question. If the answer to a question is binary (true or false), answer with either 'True' or 'False'. You answer(s) should contain as few words as possible (ex:  if the answer is a person, only answer their name). Your answer(s) should not contain full sentences, put any kind of explanations in the 'reason' field instead.
