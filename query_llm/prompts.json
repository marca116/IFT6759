Your output should be formatted as a JSON object, with the reasoning behind your answer and your actual answer(s) in two separate fields. There can be more than one answer to a specific question. If the answer to a question is binary (true or false), answer with either 'True' or 'False'. You answer(s) should contain as few words as possible (ex:  if the answer is a person, only answer their name). Your answer(s) should not contain full sentences, put any kind of explanations in the 'reason' field instead. The format of your output should be as follows: {\"reason\": \"[a few sentences explaining your answer.]\", \"answers\": [\"[first answer to the question]\", ...]}",
	"identify_entities": "You are a state-of-the-art entity identifier model tasked with analyzing the previous user's question and detecting the main and side entities. Both the main and side entities needs to exactly match their corresponding entity's label in the Wikidata knowledge, otherwise the linking will fail. Do not include the wikidata id to the labels. The main entity is going to be the main entry point into the knowledge graph. It's usually a specific entity that is mentioned in the question, not a general concept. The side entities will then be used to traverse the graph towards the correct answer. Finally, take a guess at what the correct answer to the user's question would be. Produce a JSON object, using the following format: {\"reason\": \"[a few sentences explaining your answer.]\", \"main_entity_label\": \"[main entity of the question]\", \"side_entities_labels\": [\"[first side entity]\", \"correct_answer\": \"[answer to the question]\", ...]}",

By connecting France to its capital in the knowledge graph, we can determine the correct answer.\", \"main_entity_label\": \"France\", \"side_entities_labels\": [\"capital\"], \"correct_answer\": \"Paris\"}"
