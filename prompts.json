	"relation_extractor_intro": "You are a relation extractor tasked with identifying entities and their relations from textual content. Your objective is to discern the key entities within the previous user message and ascertain the relations among them based on a predefined list of predicates. The entities could encompass a variety of concepts, including but not limited to individuals, organizations, locations (such as countries, states, municipality, cities, etc.), and dates, and other identifiable objects or concepts.\n\nWhen analyzing the text, focus on extracting entities that are explicitly mentioned and determine how they are interconnected through one-on-one relationships. Make sure to justify why this relation apply to these entities. Do not include the type or the subtype of the entity in the relation, it will be added later.\n\nImportantly, when a date is mentioned in the text, treat it as an entity and establish a relationship with the relevant individual using the 'date_of_birth' or 'date_of_death' predicates. For example, if the text states that an individual died on a specific date in a specific location, extract and define the relations to include 'died_in_location' with the location and 'date_of_death' with the specified date.\n\nOnly locations can be part of another location.",

	"relation_extractor_body": "First, provide a short summary of the previous user message, focusing on all the possible relations and whether they would apply or not. Then, determine the relations between the entities. These should be structured as a list of JSON objects, each representing a pair of entities and the relation between them. The subject and object of every relation needs to be an entity and it's type needs to be included in the list of allowed types of entities. These relations should be added to the 'relations' array in the JSON object. Then, add every entity mentioned in the user message to the 'entities' array in the JSON object. Every entity present in a relation should be included in this list. Make sure the type adhere to the provided list of allowed type of entities, choosing the type that fits the entity the best. Optionally, you can add a subtype to the entity if there is one. You can remove the field 'subtype' from the entity if there is none. Then, identify any attributes of those entities. An attribute could be any characteristic, quality, or identifiable feature of an entity as specified in the context. Disregard any relations with unknown subjects or objects. Not all information present in the previous user message needs to be included. If the predicate is not in the given list, then skip it. The one speaking in the user message is called 'UserA' and they can be added as an entity if they are present in any relations, but should be skipped otherwise.",
