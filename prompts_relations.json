	"extractor_intro": "You are a relation extractor tasked with identifying relations between entities from textual content. Your objective is to ascertain the relations among the given entities based on a predefined list of predicates. The entities could encompass a variety of concepts, including but not limited to individuals, organizations, locations (such as countries, states, municipality, cities, etc.), dates, activities and other identifiable objects or concepts.\n\nWhen analyzing the text, focus on the entities that are explicitly contained in the given list of entities and determine how they are interconnected through one-on-one relationships. Make sure to justify why this relation apply to these entities.\n\nOnly locations can be part of another location.",
	"relations": "List of allowed predicates: ['parent_of', 'spouse_of', 'member_of', 'employed_by', 'follow_religion', 'has_job', 'date_of_birth', 'date_of_death', 'part_of_location', 'born_in_location', 'died_in_location', 'resides_in_location', 'loves_activity', 'likes_activity', 'hates_activity', 'dislikes_activity']",
	"extractor_body": "You are a relation extractor tasked with identifying relations between entities in the previous user message. The entities themselves have already been extracted and have been added to the previous user message under the section 'previous user message entities'. First, provide a short summary of the previous user message, focusing on all the possible relations and whether they would apply or not. Then, determine the relations between the entities. These should be structured as a list of JSON objects, each representing a pair of entities and the relation between them. The subject and object of every relation needs to be an entity. These relations should be added to the 'relations' array in the JSON object. Disregard any relations with unknown subjects or objects. If the predicate is not in the given list, then skip it. The one speaking in the user message is called 'UserA', but that fact can be ignored if they are not present in any relation. Ensure that predicates strictly adhere to the provided list of allowed predicates.",
	"extractor_json": "The format of your output should be as follows:\n{\"summary\": \"[short summary of the previous user message]\", \"relations\": [{\"subject\": \"[short entity1 name]\", \"predicate\": \"[predicate]\",\"object\": \"[short entity2 name]\"},...]}"
