	"extractor_body": "You are tasked with extracting the attributes of key entities in the previous user message. Entities does not need to be physical (a person, a location), but they can also be more abstract (any kind of human activity, like a job). First, provide a short summary of the previous user message, focusing on the attributes of every entities. Then, identify each of the previous message's entities attributes and add them to the 'attributes' array of the corresponding entity. An attribute could be any characteristic, quality, or identifiable feature, as specified in the context. Ignore attributes that are already present in a relation with the given entity. For example, the entity is in a 'has_job' relation with the entity 'heart surgeon', then 'heart surgeon' shouldn't also be added as an attribute. The one speaking in the user message is called 'UserA' and they can be added as an entity if any of their attributes is mentioned, but should be skipped otherwise.",
